# piWater

Backend API for raspberry pi to control an automated watering system via a relay.

The intention is to have a native app call this API. (TBA)

Also see [watering_system.ino](https://github.com/Jonas94/arduino/blob/master/watering_system.ino)
for a more hardware-near solution to the same problem/application, using arduino to control the relay based on input from physical switches.
